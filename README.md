# Investigating Moran’s I Properties for Spatial Machine Learning: A Preliminary Analysis  

This repository contains the research code for the **AGILE 2025** short paper entitled "Investigating Moran’s I Properties for Spatial Machine Learning: A Preliminary Analysis".

## Getting Started

### 1. Download the Repository

- **Clone**  
- **Or download as a ZIP**, extract, and open the folder.  

### 2. Set Up the R Environment  

Start an **R session** in the project folder and run:  

```r
renv::restore()
```  

### 3. Run the Computational Pipeline  

```r
targets::tar_make()
```  

(Takes ~1 hour on a modern laptop.)  

### 4. Check the Results  

See **`figures.html`** for the output.
